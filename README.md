# PasswordManager

* A local, offline, zero-knowledge password manager with a CLI interface.
* Uses Argon2id for key derivation and AES-256-GCM for encryption.
* Supports adding, retrieving, and listing credentials stored in an encrypted vault file.
* Cross-platform: Windows and Linux.

# Update#1
* Created the crypto.py and tested it. It successfully encrypts the data and also tells if the password is wrong.
